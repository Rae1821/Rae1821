- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rachel
- ðŸŽ“ I recently completed the Front End Development Certification from Skillcrush! 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using my coding skills to work on a team of awesome front-end developers for an awesome company.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all I can about JavaScript and after that I want to learn React.js. I'm also starting to learn Figma! I am excited to learn as much as I can about front end web development.
